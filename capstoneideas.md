# The Importance of Understand At-Risk Behavior of Veterans
#####  A Capstone Project By Adam Klima

# Introduction
### Hi, my name is Adam Klima, and I am a Marine Infantry Combat Veteran. During my enlistment, I was fortunate to experience the true camaraderie, the type that is often believed to be associated with military service.  Some of these bonds, sadly, also led me to experience terrible loss.  In 2011, I was deployed to the battlefield of Sangin, Afghanistan, one that remains fairly unknown to Americans. Though the battle was conducted in many phases, the occupation of Sangin lasted from 2006 until 2017, costing many coalition and civilian lives and livelihoods.  In 2011 alone, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and its attachments took 17 KIA and 191 wounded, the majority of the wounded being double or more amputees.  I wish I could say that our losses stopped on the battlefield, unfortunately for most, regardless of the type of service, the hardest battle began when their first journey as an adult was ending. Feeling abandoned, alone, defeated, and weary from a hard-fought battle, many are tempted by the sirenâ€™s song of suicide, quite a few falling victim to the alluring promises of peace and the absence of pain. Tragically, many of these could have been avoided if the people in their lives understood whose at risk, and what the warning signs of suicide are. 

# Question
### I want to answer the question "What veterans are most at risk for suicide"

# Audience
### Veterans friends and family, as well as general public in order to raise awarness

# What databases are needed?
### National databases from both governmental and civilian sources.  They need to be unbiased as well as relatively frequent. This is due to the statistics changing year to year

# Research Needed
### Research articles and their sources, statistics and changes over the last 40 years in order to see what impact OIF and OEF had on statistics, what seperations are made in the data ie: mos, religion, age etc
